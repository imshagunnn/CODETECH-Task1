Objective
The main objective of this project is to build an advanced, user-friendly to-do list application that helps users efficiently manage their tasks. It aims to provide a clean, responsive interface with features such as task filtering, editing, completion status, and theme toggling to improve usability and customization.

Key Activities
Design & Development: Design a user interface that is easy to use, visually appealing, and responsive, with both light and dark modes.
Task Management Functionality: Implement functionality to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete or active.
LocalStorage Integration: Ensure all tasks and user preferences (e.g., dark mode) are saved and persist across browser sessions.
User Interaction Enhancements: Add features such as task filtering and animations to enhance user experience.
Testing and Optimization: Test the application for various user inputs and optimize performance, ensuring a seamless and bug-free experience.

Technologies Used
HTML: Used for creating the structure of the web application.
CSS: Used for styling the interface, including the design for dark and light modes and hover effects for tasks.
JavaScript: Responsible for implementing all the application logic, such as adding, deleting, editing tasks, updating task statuses, managing filters, and storing data in localStorage.
LocalStorage API: Used to store task data and user preferences, allowing persistence of information between sessions.
These technologies work together to create a comprehensive and interactive to-do list application that offers a feature-rich, modern experience to its users.
